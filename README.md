❛ Goose the Kiwi ❜
</p>
<p align="center">
This toon is obsessed with gardening. He acts like it's his core value, always talking about plants and food that he's grown. If he's away from greenery for too long he tends to get stressed out, resulting in him verbally shutting down. He's often found with a Starfruit toon who follows him around like the plauge - and it seems like he's taken a really big liking to him.

❛ Twisted Information ❜
</p>
<p align="center">
After seeing his friend become overcome by ichor, this toon ended up staying behind - allowing himself to be with his friend, letting the ichor consume him too. He wanders around aimlessly, looking for his friend. If toon's get too close to him, he'll apply a random debuff to them, making it harder for them to get away from him.

❛ Juice the Starfruit ❜
</p>
<p align="center">
A Starfruit toon who bares a rapier - he's often mistook for a girl from how feminine he looks, and it always gets on his nerves. He's quick to anger when misgendered, but is always calmed down fast. This toon takes pride in his loyalty, and he shows it quite often by how much he protects his friends. He's gotten into a lot of fights with the other toons over things that have upset a certain toon though.

❛ Twisted Information ❜
</p>
<p align="center">
After getting into a fight with another toon while descending the elevator, he was pushed into a machine that ended up breaking - the ichor ended up consuming him in front of everyone, including his best friend. His tall stature makes it easier for him to spot toons, being able to spot them from great distances - he's known for using his rapier to attack toons, which applies a 'Bleeding' effect when a toon is attacked. This causes the toon effected to lose Tapes over time.

❛ Creme the White Strawberry ❜
</p>
<p align="center">
This toon is a loner, often seen away from everyone just doing his own things. He loves to listen to rock music, despite his sweet appearance. When he first appeared at Gardenview, everyone thought that he was related to Sprout in some way since they were both strawberries, but much to everyone's surprise they weren't. Despite liking being alone, he's also often seen with a certain sour yet sweet lemon toon.. They look a bit closer than friends.
</p>
<p align="center">
❛ Ability One - Rock On! (Active) ❜
</p>
<p align="center">
This allows the toon to direct all Twisted attention towards himself, while also giving himself a slight stamina boost every 20 seconds.

❛ Twisted Information ❜
</p>
<p align="center">
After being left behind on a floor, the ichor slowly consumed him, but he still retained some function. He's passive, until a toon uses an item or runs around him. He'll become aggressive towards the toon who ran/used an item, and only that toon. His extended attention span makes it harder to get rid of him too, so make sure to be careful around him.

❛ Tang the Lemon ❜
</p>
<p align="center">
A sour yet sickly sweet toon, he's obsessed with making friends. He's always making sure that everyone is okay. He's always aimlessly wandering around to find people to talk to, despite how shy he often comes off as. He's always around a certain toon though - he loves to talk to people that he really shouldn't, but he just can't get enough of a certain WHite Strawberry toon.
</p>
<p align="center">
❛ Ability One - Tender Touch (Passive) ❜
</p>
<p align="center">
Every time this toon takes damage, his speed and extraction speed increases - the Twisted who attacked him takes 5 extra seconds to start moving again, allowing for toons to freely move around that Twisted.

❛ Twisted Information ❜
</p>
<p align="center">
After watching the toon he loved get left behind, he ended up staying behind on another floor - he willingly began to consume ichor, which resulted in him becoming Twisted. His cries are heard from across the floor, but he isn't aggressive. He's usually found roaming around, picking up items (picks up 1-3 items, no more) and if you want them he'll give them to you. The moment he runs out of items, however, he becomes extremely aggressive, having an extended attention span and speed boost to aid in chasing down toons.
